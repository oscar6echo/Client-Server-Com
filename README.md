## Client Server Communication
This is repo serves as a reference, a 'post-it'.  
Here a client is either a [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebook running a Python client or a website. The server is a [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) app. The website displays a [handsontable](https://handsontable.com/) that acts as an I/O conduit. The processing is performed remotely by the Flask server.  
The purpose of this repo is to demonstrate the client/server communication.

### Run
+ [WS_Server.ipynb](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/oscar6echo/Client-Server-Com/blob/master/WS_Server.ipynb) notebook to run the server.  
+ [WS_Client_Python.ipynb](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/oscar6echo/Client-Server-Com/blob/master/WS_Client_Python.ipynb) notebook to test the server.
+ [WS_Client_Web.ipynb](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/oscar6echo/Client-Server-Com/blob/master/WS_Client_Web.ipynb) notebook to install the js libs and launch the website.

### Doc
Cf. the [handsontable docs](https://docs.handsontable.com/0.28.0/tutorial-introduction.html) to improve this basic handsontable example.
